## How Team Profile Generator Works
Team Profile Generator is a software engineering team generator command line application. Team Profile Generator prompts the user with questions using inquirer regarding the team manager, engineers, and interns. The user can input as many team members as they would like. Once the user finishes and selects the "no more employees to add" prompt, then the application will render an HTML file that displays a neatly formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
